In this paper, we present a survey of the previous definitions, metrics, and evaluation methodologies which have been used for software learnability. Our survey of evaluation methodologies leads us to a new question-suggestion protocol, which, in a user study, was shown to expose a significantly higher number of learnability issues in comparison to a more traditional think-aloud protocol. Based on the issues identified in our study, we present a classification system of learnability issues, and demonstrate how these categories can lead to guidelines for addressing the associated challenges.},

Good learnability not only leads to a better productivity quickly but also plays a vital role in initial adoption or rejection of a technology. To evaluate and hence improve learnability, understanding the factors affecting learnability is necessary. In this paper we develop a comprehensive model of learnability by identifying and then abstracting learnability attributes logically to lower level. We carry out a case study to prove adequacy of the proposed model. This learnability attribute model can set a baseline for future learnability understanding and evaluation.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to test the hypothesis whether computer anxiety has a hindering eﬀect on experienced computer users while performing complex computer tasks. Participants were 75 third-year psychology students taking a Delphi programming course. Prior to the course, a computer anxiety scale was ﬁlled in. Computer performance was measured in four diﬀerent ways: through ﬁnal course grade, predicted ﬁnal grade, self-perceived programming skills, and through observed behavior while programming a computer application. The results showed that computer anxiety was found to correlate with the studentsÕ prediction of their ﬁnal grade and with the perception of their own computer skills, but had no eﬀect on actual performance as measured by the ﬁnal course grade. Furthermore, there was no signiﬁcant eﬀect of computer anxiety on behavioral measures while students were programming a computer application. The ﬁndings point into the direction of a ‘‘threshold eﬀect’’, where anxiety only hinders performance when this anxiety is suﬃciently severe or when the context in which the task to be executed on a computer is ambiguous.},

	abstract = {With the increasing use of different types of technologies in everyday life, one would expect that the use of computers would be comfortable for everyone. However, some people still feel apprehensive before and during computer use, experiencing multiple levels of anxiety and, for high levels, exhibit what is known as Computer Anxiety (CA). People with CA face problems using technologies in different contexts, including situations in which they use computers because they have no alternative, such as using government services available only through computer systems, exercising citizenship by voting with electronic voting machines, ATMs and using computers at work. Computer Anxiety can create multiple barriers for these people, depriving them of access to technology, education, full exercise of citizenship, among others. In this context, the present project investigated the main characteristics related to how elderly people with Computer Anxiety interact with computers and how these characteristics are represented in interaction logs. To this end, a field study was conducted with 31 elderly participants involving the capture of data related to interaction, eye tracking data, depression and anxiety levels screening scales, computational anxiety screening scales, among others. Based on the results, a model for Computer Anxiety detection was developed. This model is able to identify different levels of Computer Anxiety (i.e., no anxiety, low level of Computer Anxiety and high level of Computer Anxiety) with accuracy of 83.87\%, showing that it is possible to identify different levels of Computer Anxiety of elderly people interacting with the Web through analysis of interaction data logs.},

	abstract = {This paper elaborates the empirical evidence of a usability evaluation of a VR and non-VR virtual tour application for a living museum. The System Usability Scale (SUS) was used in between participants experiments (Group 1: non-VR version and Group 2: VR version) with 40 participants. The results show that the mean scores of all components for the VR version are higher compared to the non-VR version, overall SUS score (72.10 vs 68.10), usability score (75.50 vs 71.70), and learnability (58.40 vs 57.00). Further analysis using a two-tailed independent t test showed no difference between the non-VR and VR versions. Additionally, no significant difference was observed between the groups in the context of gender, nationality, and prior experience (other VR tour applications) for overall SUS score, usability score, and learnability score. Α two-tailed independent t test indicated no significant difference in the usability score between participants with VR experience and no VR experience. However, a significant difference was found between participants with VR experience and no VR experience for both SUS score (t(38) = 2.17, p = 0.037) and learnability score (t(38) = 2.40, p = 0.021). The independent t test results indicated a significant difference between participant with and without previous visits to SCV for the usability score (t(38) = −2.31, p = 0.027), while there was no significant differences observed in other components. It can be concluded that both versions passed based on the SUS score. However, the sub-scale usability and learnability scores indicated some usability issue.},

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 older adults in China, where the aging population is the largest and digital banking grows fast. We also interviewed bank employees to gain complementary perspectives of these help givers. Our fndings show that older adults used both physical and digital platforms as an ecosystem based on perceived pros and cons. Perceived usefulness, self-confdence, and social infuence were key motivators for learning digital banking. They experienced app-related (e.g., insufcient error-recovery support) and user-related challenges (e.g., trust, security and privacy concerns, low perceived self-efcacy) and developed coping strategies. We discuss design considerations to improve their banking experiences.},

Following this evolution, it is crucial that its content allows access to the different user's profiles. Older adults (age 60+) are users who typically have limited capacities due to ageing process and they have encountered difficulties in interacting with websites. Several accessibility and usability issues still have to be solved, despite the legislation and guidelines established for the development of accessible and usable web content. In particular, little attention has been devoted to the difficulties faced by older adults because most websites are not designed with these users in mind. This paper addresses the development of a checklist, a support to web accessibility and usability evaluations for the older adults profile and its validation. The checklist was elaborated from analysis of the state of the art, based on a literature review. During the checklist development we investigated the main barriers faced by older adults in web interaction. We conclude by highlighting the need for more studies on web interaction by older people and proposing new strategies for future research.},

	abstract = {Since the release of the first mobile devices, the usability of on-board applications has been the concern not only of software vendors but hardware manufacturers as well. The academia community later willingly joined the discussion on usability in terms of theory and empirical measurement, having experience and knowledge in desktop settings. At first sight, such a background should guarantee a solid foundation to conduct research on software usability in a new setting. However, a preliminary study on the subject matter revealed methodological disorder in contemporary literature. As a matter of fact, a need emerged to review existing usability definitions, attributes and measures to recognize all associated aspects. In order to fill this void, we conducted a systematic literature review on usability studies indexed by the Scopus database and devoted to mobile applications. The input volume covers 790 documents from 2001 to 2018. The data analysis shows that the ISO 9241-11 usability definition has been adopted in an unchanged form and popularized as the standard by the HCI community. Secondly, in total, 75 attributes were identified and analysed. The most frequent are efficiency (70\%), satisfaction (66\%) and effectiveness (58\%), which directly originate from the above definition. Subsequently, the less frequent are learnability (45\%), memorability (23\%), cognitive load (19\%) and errors (17\%). The last two concern simplicity (13\%) and ease of use (9\%). Thirdly, in the evaluation of usability, controlled observation and surveys are two major research methods applied, while eye-tracking, thinking aloud and interview are hardly used and serve as complementary to collect additional data. Moreover, usability evaluations are often confused with user experience dimensions, covering not only application quality characteristics, but also user beliefs, emotions and preferences. All these results indicate the need for further research on the usability of mobile applications, aiming to establish a consensus in the theory and practice among all interested parties.},

	abstract = {Technological advances are increasingly rapid and it is up to the Public Administration to develop a public management environment capable of keeping up with this pace of change. Based on this scenario, this article addresses the possibilities of using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) aimed at the realization of social rights, through the direct provision of public services, using the notion of digital government. Therefore, the study is divided into three moments: first, the notion of digital government is presented based on technological advance; then, the possibilities of applying ICTs as tools aimed at providing public services in Brazil are analyzed; finally, the perspectives and challenges of this implementation are discussed, in order to conclude that the digital government corresponds to the use of information and communication technologies in the provision of public services. The research adopts the deductive method and the bibliographic research technique, through indirect documentation.},
