	abstract = {It is well-accepted that learnability is an important aspect of usability, yet there is little agreement as to how learnability should be defined, measured, and evaluated. In this paper, we present a survey of the previous definitions, metrics, and evaluation methodologies which have been used for software learnability. Our survey of evaluation methodologies leads us to a new question-suggestion protocol, which, in a user study, was shown to expose a significantly higher number of learnability issues in comparison to a more traditional think-aloud protocol. Based on the issues identified in our study, we present a classification system of learnability issues, and demonstrate how these categories can lead to guidelines for addressing the associated challenges.},

	abstract = {Learnability has been regarded as a fundamental usability attribute and plays a significant role for the success of software applications. Good learnability not only leads to a better productivity quickly but also plays a vital role in initial adoption or rejection of a technology. To evaluate and hence improve learnability, understanding the factors affecting learnability is necessary. In this paper we develop a comprehensive model of learnability by identifying and then abstracting learnability attributes logically to lower level. We carry out a case study to prove adequacy of the proposed model. This learnability attribute model can set a baseline for future learnability understanding and evaluation.},

The main conclusions are: the elderly obtained performances generally lower than young people in the tasks; ease of learning was observed and measured in both groups of volunteers; factors such as experience in the use of technology have made the performance of the seniors similar to the young.},

A convenience sampling approach was used to identify study participants. Data were gathered in 2021 through 15 qualitative interviews with adults ranging in age from 65 to 87; all resided in the United States. Interviews were conducted via phone and video conferencing technology. Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems model was the overarching conceptual framework used to understand system influences that help explain older adults’ relationship with {ICT} and how this may change over time due to environmental forces and factors. Other models and theories considered in this study were the relative deprivation theory and the technology readiness and acceptance model.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to test the hypothesis whether computer anxiety has a hindering eﬀect on experienced computer users while performing complex computer tasks. Participants were 75 third-year psychology students taking a Delphi programming course. Prior to the course, a computer anxiety scale was ﬁlled in. Computer performance was measured in four diﬀerent ways: through ﬁnal course grade, predicted ﬁnal grade, self-perceived programming skills, and through observed behavior while programming a computer application. The results showed that computer anxiety was found to correlate with the {studentsÕ} prediction of their ﬁnal grade and with the perception of their own computer skills, but had no eﬀect on actual performance as measured by the ﬁnal course grade. Furthermore, there was no signiﬁcant eﬀect of computer anxiety on behavioral measures while students were programming a computer application. The ﬁndings point into the direction of a ‘‘threshold eﬀect’’, where anxiety only hinders performance when this anxiety is suﬃciently severe or when the context in which the task to be executed on a computer is ambiguous.},

	abstract = {With the increasing use of different types of technologies in everyday life, one would expect that the use of computers would be comfortable for everyone. However, some people still feel apprehensive before and during computer use, experiencing multiple levels of anxiety and, for high levels, exhibit what is known as Computer Anxiety ({CA}). People with {CA} face problems using technologies in different contexts, including situations in which they use computers because they have no alternative, such as using government services available only through computer systems, exercising citizenship by voting with electronic voting machines, {ATMs} and using computers at work. Computer Anxiety can create multiple barriers for these people, depriving them of access to technology, education, full exercise of citizenship, among others. In this context, the present project investigated the main characteristics related to how elderly people with Computer Anxiety interact with computers and how these characteristics are represented in interaction logs. To this end, a field study was conducted with 31 elderly participants involving the capture of data related to interaction, eye tracking data, depression and anxiety levels screening scales, computational anxiety screening scales, among others. Based on the results, a model for Computer Anxiety detection was developed. This model is able to identify different levels of Computer Anxiety (i.e., no anxiety, low level of Computer Anxiety and high level of Computer Anxiety) with accuracy of 83.87\%, showing that it is possible to identify different levels of Computer Anxiety of elderly people interacting with the Web through analysis of interaction data logs.},

	abstract = {This paper elaborates the empirical evidence of a usability evaluation of a {VR} and non-{VR} virtual tour application for a living museum. The System Usability Scale ({SUS}) was used in between participants experiments (Group 1: non-{VR} version and Group 2: {VR} version) with 40 participants. The results show that the mean scores of all components for the {VR} version are higher compared to the non-{VR} version, overall {SUS} score (72.10 vs 68.10), usability score (75.50 vs 71.70), and learnability (58.40 vs 57.00). Further analysis using a two-tailed independent t test showed no difference between the non-{VR} and {VR} versions. Additionally, no significant difference was observed between the groups in the context of gender, nationality, and prior experience (other {VR} tour applications) for overall {SUS} score, usability score, and learnability score. Α two-tailed independent t test indicated no significant difference in the usability score between participants with {VR} experience and no {VR} experience. However, a significant difference was found between participants with {VR} experience and no {VR} experience for both {SUS} score (t(38) = 2.17, p = 0.037) and learnability score (t(38) = 2.40, p = 0.021). The independent t test results indicated a significant difference between participant with and without previous visits to {SCV} for the usability score (t(38) = −2.31, p = 0.027), while there was no significant differences observed in other components. It can be concluded that both versions passed based on the {SUS} score. However, the sub-scale usability and learnability scores indicated some usability issue.},

As digital banking platforms (e.g., mobile apps, electronic payment) gradually replace physical ones, it is critical to understand how they adapt to digital banking and the potential frictions they experience. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 older adults in China, where the aging population is the largest and digital banking grows fast. We also interviewed bank employees to gain complementary perspectives of these help givers. Our fndings show that older adults used both physical and digital platforms as an ecosystem based on perceived pros and cons. Perceived usefulness, self-confdence, and social infuence were key motivators for learning digital banking. They experienced app-related (e.g., insufcient error-recovery support) and user-related challenges (e.g., trust, security and privacy concerns, low perceived self-efcacy) and developed coping strategies. We discuss design considerations to improve their banking experiences.},

We experiment with the proposed model to evaluate three user groups: elderly, young, and military groups with six information services: {ScienceON}, {RISS}, Web of Science, {IEEE} Xplore, {DTIMS}, and Air university library. The experimental results show that our approach works well in prioritizing attractiveness and learnability for elderly group, searchability for young group, and understandability and searchability for military user group.},
